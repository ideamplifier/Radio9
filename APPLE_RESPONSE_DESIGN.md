# Apple Review Response - Design & Metadata Issues

Hello,

Thank you for your detailed feedback. We will address all the issues identified:

## Guideline 4.0 - Design (iPad Layout)
We will optimize the iPad layout to ensure better usability:
- Improve spacing and layout for iPad screens
- Ensure all controls are easily accessible on larger screens
- Test thoroughly on iPad Air 5th generation

## Guideline 2.3.3 - Screenshots (6.7-inch iPhone)
We will update all screenshots to:
- Show the current version (1.1.0) of the app
- Display the actual podcast player interface in use
- Remove any outdated UI elements
- Ensure consistency across all device sizes

## Guideline 2.3.4 - App Preview
We will create a new app preview that:
- Shows only direct screen recordings from the app
- Removes all device frames and device images
- Demonstrates the core podcast playing functionality
- Uses full-screen captures without external frames

We understand the importance of accurate representation and will ensure all media assets properly reflect the current app experience across all supported devices.

We will resubmit once these changes are complete.

Thank you for your patience and guidance.

Best regards
