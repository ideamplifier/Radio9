# Apple Review Response

## Response to Guideline 5.2.3 - Legal

Hello,

Thank you for your feedback. We have completely addressed the copyright concerns by making significant changes to our app:

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed all potentially problematic radio stations** - We have removed ALL radio stations that could have any copyright issues.

2. **Added only copyright-free stations** - We now exclusively feature stations that broadcast:
   - Creative Commons licensed content (RadioNOS)
   - Public Domain classical music (Musopen)
   - Listener-supported, ad-free content (SomaFM)
   - Stations with explicit permission for third-party streaming

3. **Current station list (Japan only):**
   - 24/7 LoFi Radio - Creative Commons hip-hop beats
   - RadioNOS Ambient - Creative Commons ambient music
   - Musopen Classical - Public Domain classical recordings
   - SomaFM Deep Space - Listener-supported ambient
   - SomaFM Secret Agent - Listener-supported lounge music

**Documentation:**
- RadioNOS explicitly states on their website that they broadcast Creative Commons licensed content
- Musopen (musopen.org) provides royalty-free, public domain classical music
- SomaFM is a listener-supported, commercial-free internet radio that allows third-party apps to stream their content
- All stations are freely accessible without any authentication or subscription requirements

**Future Plans:**
We will continue to carefully add only legally cleared, copyright-free stations in future updates. Each new station will be thoroughly verified for proper licensing before inclusion.

**Additional Measures:**
- We've disabled country selection features temporarily to ensure quality control
- All other countries now show "Coming soon" while we verify legal stations for each region
- We are committed to 100% legal compliance

We believe these changes fully address the copyright concerns. The app now only provides access to legally free, publicly available radio streams with appropriate licenses.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
