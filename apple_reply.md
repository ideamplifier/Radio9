# Reply to App Review - Radio9 (Submission ID: 74ad2740-eb9f-42ac-9cfe-056bdeafb2d7)

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your review. I understand your concerns regarding Guideline 5.2.3 - Intellectual Property, and I would like to provide clarification about Radio9's functionality and legal compliance.

## App Functionality

Radio9 is a **radio tuner interface** that helps users discover and access publicly available internet radio streams. The app functions similarly to a traditional radio receiver, but for internet streams instead of FM/AM frequencies.

## Legal Compliance

1. **Public Stream Access Only**: Radio9 exclusively provides access to radio streams that are:
   - Publicly broadcast on the internet
   - Freely accessible without authentication
   - Intended for public consumption by the broadcasters themselves

2. **No Content Hosting**: Our app does not host, store, or redistribute any audio content. We simply provide a tuner interface that connects users to streams already publicly available on the internet.

3. **Legal Notice Implementation**: We have implemented a comprehensive legal disclaimer in our Settings view (visible in SettingsModalView.swift) that clearly states:
   - All content is provided by third-party broadcasters
   - We do not host or control any content
   - Users are responsible for compliance with local regulations

## Documentary Evidence

As requested, here is the documentary evidence supporting our legal right to provide this service:

1. **Public Radio Directory API Documentation**: 
   - Our station data comes from radio-browser.info, a community-driven public radio directory
   - API Documentation: https://api.radio-browser.info/
   - This service aggregates publicly available radio streams similar to how search engines index public websites

2. **Precedent Applications**:
   - Similar apps like "Radio Garden" (App ID: 1339670993) and "Simple Radio" (App ID: 891132290) operate on the same principle of providing access to publicly available streams
   - These apps have been available on the App Store for years

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Our app acts as a web browser specifically for audio streams
   - Just as Safari can access any public website, Radio9 accesses public radio streams
   - We respect broadcaster preferences and immediately remove any station upon request

## Recent Changes

In response to your previous feedback, we have:
- Removed all potentially problematic commercial stations
- Disabled dynamic station loading from external APIs
- Focused exclusively on public, community, and internet-only stations
- Added comprehensive legal disclaimers in multiple languages

## Comparison to Web Browsers

Radio9's relationship to radio streams is analogous to how web browsers relate to websites:
- Web browsers don't need permission from every website they can access
- They provide a tool for users to access publicly available content
- The responsibility for content lies with the content providers, not the browser

Similarly, Radio9 is a specialized browser for publicly available radio streams.

## Commitment

We are committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and App Store guidelines. If there are specific stations or features that concern you, we are prepared to remove them immediately.

We believe Radio9 provides valuable functionality for users to discover and enjoy publicly available radio content from around the world, similar to how they might use a traditional radio or web browser.

Thank you for your consideration. We are available to provide any additional information or make any necessary modifications to ensure compliance.

Best regards,
HOSONO Radio Team
