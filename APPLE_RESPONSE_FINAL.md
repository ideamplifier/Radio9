# Apple Review Response

Hello,

Thank you for your review. We have completely restructured our app to address the copyright concerns under Guideline 5.2.3.

**We have removed ALL radio stations and converted our app to a podcast-only player.**

Our app now:
- Only plays podcasts from public RSS feeds
- Does not stream any radio stations
- Does not play any copyrighted music

The podcasts we include (such as Rebuild.fm, Bilingual News, and COTEN RADIO) are:
- Published with public RSS feeds specifically for distribution
- Intended by their creators to be played through podcast apps
- Similar to content available in Apple Podcasts and other podcast players

This is fundamentally different from radio streaming. Podcast creators publish RSS feeds because they want their content to be distributed through apps like ours. This is the standard podcast distribution model.

We believe this fully resolves the copyright concerns, as we are now operating as a standard podcast player, not a radio streaming app.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards
