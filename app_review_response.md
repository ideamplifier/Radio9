# Response to App Review - Guideline 5.2.3

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding Guideline 5.2.3. I would like to clarify Radio9's functionality and provide the requested documentation.

## About Radio9

Radio9 is a **radio tuner interface** that helps users discover and access publicly available internet radio streams. The app functions as a specialized browser for radio content, similar to how Safari accesses websites.

## Legal Compliance & Rights

1. **Public Streams Only**: Radio9 exclusively accesses radio streams that are:
   - Publicly broadcast on the internet
   - Freely accessible without authentication or subscription
   - Intended for public consumption by the broadcasters

2. **No Content Hosting**: We do not host, store, or redistribute any audio content. We simply provide an interface to connect users to publicly available streams.

3. **Legal Disclaimers**: We have implemented comprehensive legal notices in our app (Settings > Legal Notice) stating that all content is provided by third parties.

## Documentary Evidence

### 1. Public Radio Directory Source
- Our station data comes from **Radio-Browser.info**, a community-driven public radio directory
- API Documentation: https://api.radio-browser.info/
- This is an open-source project that aggregates publicly available radio streams

### 2. Industry Standard Practice
- Similar apps operate on the same principle:
  - Radio Garden (App ID: 1339670993)
  - Simple Radio (App ID: 891132290)
  - TuneIn Radio
- These apps have been on the App Store for years using the same model

### 3. Legal Basis
- Radio9 operates like a web browser for audio streams
- Just as browsers don't need permission from every website, radio tuners access public broadcasts
- We respect all DMCA and takedown requests

## Recent Compliance Updates

In response to previous feedback, we have:
- Removed all commercial radio stations
- Disabled external API station loading
- Focused exclusively on public and community stations
- Added multi-language legal disclaimers

## Our Commitment

We are committed to full compliance with App Store guidelines. If there are specific concerns about any stations or features, we will address them immediately.

Radio9 provides a valuable service for users to discover publicly available radio content from around the world, functioning as a specialized browser for audio streams rather than a content provider.

Thank you for your consideration. We are ready to provide any additional information needed.

Best regards,
Radio9 Development Team
