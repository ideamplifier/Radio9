# Apple Review Response - FINAL VERSION

## Response to Guideline 5.2.3 - Legal

Hello,

Thank you for your clarification. We have simplified our app to address all concerns:

**Our app now contains ONLY ONE radio station:**
- **Musopen Radio** - Streams 100% PUBLIC DOMAIN classical music

**About Musopen:**
- Website: https://musopen.org
- Mission: "We provide free, copyright-free classical music to the public"
- All content is explicitly PUBLIC DOMAIN (no copyright restrictions)
- Quote from their website: "All music is copyright free"

**Why this is legally compliant:**
1. **Public Domain = No Copyright** - These works are free for anyone to use
2. **No permissions needed** - Public domain content requires no licensing
3. **Musopen's stated purpose** - They exist specifically to provide copyright-free music

**Documentation available at:**
- About page: https://musopen.org/about/
- FAQ: https://musopen.org/faq/
- Music catalog: https://musopen.org/music/

**Our commitment:**
- This app ONLY streams PUBLIC DOMAIN classical music from Musopen.org
- We will not add any stations without proper licensing documentation
- Future updates will maintain 100% legal compliance

Since public domain content has no copyright restrictions, there are no rights to violate. This fully addresses the legal concerns under Guideline 5.2.3.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
